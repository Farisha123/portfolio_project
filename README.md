FINANCIAL DATASET PROJECT

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an important part of every data scientist’s workflow. EDA allows data scientists to summarize the most important characteristics of the data they’re working with. In the case of financial data analysis, this includes generating simple summary statistics such as standard deviation in returns and average returns, visualizing relationships between stocks through correlation heatmaps, generating stock price time series plots, boxplots, and more.
  
The pandas-datareader is a Python library that allows users tostatistical analysis tasks such as calculating returns, risk, moving averages, and more. In addition, matplotlib and seaborn are libraries in Python that further allow you to create data visualizations such as scatterplot,barplot, boxplots and time series plots. The combination of these libraries enable data scientists to pull powerful insights from financial data with relatively few lines of code.

Power BI is a cloud-based business analytics service that enables anyone to visualize and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding. It connects users to a broad range of live data through easy-to-use dashboards, provides interactive reports, and delivers compelling visualizations that bring data to life. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.In here we use piechart,donut chart,cards,table for visualization of data.

We gets the following conclusions from the dataset 'Financial sample'.

• The financial dataset gives datas of years 2013 and 2014.
•There are 700 rows and 16 columns.
•From the column 'sales' we get the total sale is 118.73 dollar.
•1.13 million product sold totally.
•The most sold product is 'Paseo',it is 27.8% of total.The least is 'Carretera'.
•The country 'US' made the highest sale.
•Then the 44.22% of sales made by the segment 'goverment'
•The highest profit fro the country 'France'.

These are the inferences from the dataset 'financial sample' by analyzing it by using
python and powerbi.
